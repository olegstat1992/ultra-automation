# Ultra Automation Framework Demo

This repo contains:

- The UI automation framework for the [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com/) using the **Playwright** and **JS**, performing the purchase flow. Playwright docs: [playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/)
- The API automation framework of the Users endpoint from [gorest.co.in](https://gorest.co.in/) using **Postman** and **Newman**. **JS** is used for writing the scripts and tests as well. Newman docs: [newman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/using-newman-cli/command-line-integration-with-newman/)

## Features

**Common**:

- Integration with CI/CD (Github Actions): E2E, API, and Linter tests are executed in the cloud each time the **main** branch is synchronized (on every commit). Email notifications on test run fail.
- All frameworks are in the same repo
- NPM used as the package manager gives the possibility to customize the run scripts and integrate with a wide variety of tech, as well as make the project setup straightforward
- Linter tests are executed on each commit. It is possible to run them manually from the command line as well

**Playwright UI Automation Framework**:

- Multiple browsers support using the DevTools protocol: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, as well as mobile versions
- Parametrized test execution: headed/headless run,  number of retries, number of workers for parallel execution, etc.
- Automatic async/await eliminates the need for waits
- Page Object Model used as the test design pattern. JS classes are used as page objects
- Extent HTML reports, as well as console reports, useful for CI/CD execution
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recordings on the first retry
- Trace recording for failed tests
- Integration with CI/CD
- many more

**Postman/Newman API Framework:**

- Possibility to run from the console
- HTML and console reports
- Random input data generation
- Dynamic variables
- Pre-request scripts
- Integration with CI/CD
